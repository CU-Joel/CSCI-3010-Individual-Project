# CSCI-3010-Individual-Project

All you have to do to run the spades program is put all 7 files (Deck.hpp, Deck.cpp, Player.hpp, Player.cpp, Game.hpp, Game.cpp, main.cpp) in the same folder, navigate to the folder in command line and then enter following commands in the command line:

$ g++ -std=c++11 *.cpp
$ ./a.out

And that's it, you're playing the game.

The program has been tested in command line on Mac, command line on linux (CS VM), and in Xcode (just create a new command line c++ project, remove the main.cpp that is put in automatically, add all 7 files and push the play button. It looks better in Xcode.)
